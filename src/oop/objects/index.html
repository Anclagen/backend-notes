      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold my-4">Classes as Objects</h2>
      <p>
        In JavaScript, classes are objects. They are a special kind of object that can be used to create other objects. Classes are used to define the structure of an object, including its properties
        and methods.
      </p>
      <p class="my-2 text-md font-semibold">An Object</p>
      <div class="p-1">
        <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap">
          <code class="language-javascript">
const myObject = {
  name: "Bob",
  age: 20,
  measurements: {
      height: 189,
      weight: 90,
  },
  setStatus: function (status) {
      this.myStatus = status;
  },
  getStatus: function() {
      return this.myStatus;
  },
};
          </code>
        </pre>
      </div>

      <p class="my-2 text-md font-semibold">A Class</p>
      <div class="p-1">
        <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap">
          <code class="language-javascript">
class MyClass {
  constructor(name, age, height, weight) {
      this.name = name;
      this.age = age;
      this.measurements = {
          height: height,
          weight: weight,
      };
  }

  setStatus(status) {
      this.myStatus = status;
  }

  get status() {
      return this.myStatus;
  }
}

const myInstance = new MyClass("Alice", 25, 170, 60);
          </code>
        </pre>
      </div>
      <p>
        Both the object and the class have the same properties and methods. The difference is that the class is a blueprint for creating objects, while the created object is an instance of the class.
        Also when logging myInstance vs myObject to the console, you will see that myInstance is an instance of MyClass (In chrome not firefox.), while myObject is an object and the methods aren't
        displayed as properties of the object of MyClass (In chrome/firefox).
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold my-4">Object Constructors</h2>
      <p>
        Object constructors are functions that are used to create new objects. They are similar to classes in that they define the structure of an object, including its properties and methods.
        However, object constructors are not as flexible as classes, as they do not support inheritance or other advanced features. Also you may see the suggestion to use classes over object
        constructors in your IDE as ES6 classes are preferred over object constructors.
      </p>

      <div class="p-1">
        <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap">
        <code class="language-javascript">
function Person(name, age, height, weight) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  this.measurements = {
      height: height,
      weight: weight,
  }

  this.setStatus = function(status) {
      this.myStatus = status;
  }

  this.getStatus = function() {
      return this.myStatus;
  }
};

const myPerson = new Person("Alice", 25, 170, 60);
        </code>
      </pre>
      </div>
      <p>
        The Person function is an object constructor that creates a new object with the specified properties and methods. The new keyword is used to create a new instance of the object constructor,
        which can then be used to create new objects and like classes when console logging myPerson you will see that it is an instance of Person and the methods are displayed as properties of the
        object.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold my-4">Object Prototypes</h2>
      <p>
        Object prototypes are used to add new properties and methods to an existing object. They are similar to classes in that they define the structure of an object, but they are more flexible and
        can be used to add new properties and methods to an object after it has been created. Object prototypes are used to add new properties and methods to an existing object. They are similar to
        classes in that they define the structure of an object, but they are more flexible and can be used to add new properties and methods to an object after it has been created.
      </p>
      <div class="p-1">
        <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap">
          <code class="language-javascript">
function Person(name, age, height, weight) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  this.measurements = {
      height: height,
      weight: weight,
  }
};

Person.prototype.setStatus = function(status) {
  this.myStatus = status;
};

Person.prototype.getStatus = function() {
  return this.myStatus;
};

const myPerson = new Person("Alice", 25, 170, 60);
          </code>
        </pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        The Person function is an object constructor that creates a new object with the specified properties. The setStatus and getStatus methods are added to the Person prototype, which allows them
        to be accessed by all instances of the Person object. When console logging myPerson you will see that it is an instance of Person and the methods are displayed as properties of the object.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold my-4">Object Inheritance & Composition</h2>
      <p>
        Object inheritance is a way of creating new objects that inherit properties and methods from existing objects.Object composition is a way of creating new objects by combining existing objects.
        It is a more flexible alternative to inheritance, as it allows objects to be combined in different ways to create new objects.
      </p>
      <p class="my-2 text-md font-semibold">Inheritance</p>

          </code>
        </pre>

      <p>
        The Person function is an object constructor that creates a new object with the specified properties and methods. The Employee function is an object constructor that creates a new object with
        the specified properties and methods, and inherits properties and methods from the Person object. The getJobTitle method is added to the Employee prototype, which allows it to be accessed by
        all instances of the Employee object. When console logging myEmployee you will see that it is an instance of Employee and the methods are displayed as properties of the object.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold my-4">Object Iterables</h2>
      <p>
        Object iterables are objects that can be iterated over using a for...of loop. They are similar to arrays in that they can be used to store multiple values, but they are more flexible and can
        be used to store key-value pairs. Object iterables are objects that can be iterated over using a for...of loop. They are similar to arrays in that they can be used to store multiple values,

        The myObject object is an object iterable that stores key-value pairs. The for...of loop is used to iterate over the key-value pairs in the myObject object, and the key and value of each pair
        are logged to the console. When console logging myObject you will see that it is an object and the properties are displayed as properties of the object.

        <b>next():</b> The next() method returns an object with two properties: done and value. The done property is a boolean that indicates whether the iterator has reached the end of the iterable.

        The myObject object is an object iterable that stores key-value pairs. The [Symbol.iterator] property is used to define a custom iterator for the myObject object. The iterator returns an
        object with a next() method that returns the value of each key in the myObject object. The for...of loop is used to iterate over the values returned by the iterator, and the values are logged
        to the console. When console logging myObject you will see that it is an object and the properties are displayed as properties of the object.
